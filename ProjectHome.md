Today SCADA systems are products closed and without small or any support for open source databases, IHM, controllers, etc.

The aim of the project is make a SCADA open source that use open source and give the freedom of modifications, improvements or adaptation to the plant process.

The system has been working several years at CERN and now I would like to give the code for improvement and general use.

Mainly is based on Siemens PLC's S5, S7300 and S7400 but can easily been adapted to other hardware.
